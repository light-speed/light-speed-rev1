# Light Speed

Light Speed is a space flight simulation where points are accumulated as players race through rings that are dynamically positioned while avoiding space debris. Light Speed is built on an architecture of Three.js, React, Redux, Express, & PostgreSQL. We also built out custom Blender models and enjoyed exploring the possibilities of zero gravity flight within the browser.
